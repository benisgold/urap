        <p>Thank you for answering the survey portion of the experiment. The survey questions were
        all about pro-sociality, or voluntary behavior intended to benefit another.
        Wikipedia defines pro-social behavior as a social behavior that benefit[s] other people or
        society as a whole, such as helping, sharing, donating, cooperating, and volunteering.</p>
        <p>You all were scored on your pro-sociality based on your answers and the answers of
        others participating in the experiment. We will use this later.</p>
