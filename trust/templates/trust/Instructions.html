    <p>Now you will play some rounds of the game. You will be randomly assigned to Player A or Player B. You will play both sequentially and simultaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Sequential Play:</strong> When you play sequentially Player A will decide then Player B sees Player A’s decision and makes their decision on how much to return. Then both participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
    <p><strong>Simultaneous Play:</strong> When you play simultaneously Player A will decide. While Player A is deciding Player B will simultaneously decide what percentage to return to Player A. Then both participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
    <p><strong class="text-info">Treatment Reveal:</strong> When you are player A , you will always be matched with someone of a certain pro-­‐social score. You will be random assigned different players each round, but they will always have the same pro-­‐social score. Thus if you are player A in round 1 and matched with an above pro-­‐social score median type you will be paired with an above pro-­‐social score median type, but not the same person, every time you are player A.</p>
