    <p>Now you will play some rounds of the game. You will be randomly assigned to Player A or Player B. You will play both sequentially and simultaneously.</p>
    <p><strong>Sequential Play:</strong> When you play sequentially Player A will decide then Player B sees Player Aâ€™s decision and makes their decision on how much to return. Then both participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
    <p><strong>Simultaneous Play:</strong> When you play simultaneously Player A will decide. While Player A is deciding Player B will simultaneously decide what percentage to return to Player A. Then both participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
