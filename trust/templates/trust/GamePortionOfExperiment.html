        We will now continue to the game portion of the experiment. You will
        play many rounds and be involved in different variations of a game
        where you are always paired with one other player.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment we will randomly select a round from this
        game to count for your payoffs. However much you earned in that
        randomly chosen round will be added to your $5 payoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be paired with an anonymous partner. You will either play the
        part of Player A or Player B. The game works as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        Player A is given $10 which they decide how to allocate between themselves and
        Player B. Player B starts off with $0 and receives triple (3X) the amount
        Player A decides to share with player B. Note that in this game,
        Player B can choose to return part or all of the money received from Player A.
    </p>
    <p>The following is an example scenario:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A has $10 and player B has $0.
        Player A decides to give player B $5. Player B receives 3*$5 = $15.
        Player B can then chooses to return $5 of the $15. At the end of the
        round, player A gets $10 as payoff and Player B also gets $10 as payoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, you’ll play some rounds of the game simultaneously where
        player B decides what percentage of the money to send at the same time
        as player A decides how much to send. We’ll walk you through the
        difference between sequential and simultaneous play later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, remember that the money involved is real and heavily impacts
        the payment for participants at the end. The allocation of the money
        involved is completely up to you.
